SISC Project Part 1
Nick Smith, Alan Rolla

Part 1 Implementation was completed by first creating the necessary wires for the datapath.
Following their creation, we instantiated every module with the necessary inputs and outputs to link them all together and allow passing data between them.
After instantiaton and creation of the $monitor(...) line, the SISC.v file was complete.

Following completion of the SISC.v file, it was necessary to define the correct outputs from CTRL.v.
To do this, we created a series of if/else statements to first check whether the operation is a NOOP, and then check the state the machine was in.
If fed a NOOP, we could set the three necessary outputs to zero. Otherwise, in fetching state we would also set the outputs to zero.
In decoding state, we did not have any logic that was crucial to this part of the project.
In execution state, we would check the mm value to see if we needed to override the ALU so it understands it is being fed an immediate value.
After execution state is mem state, where under our operations we would need to set RF_WE to 1 so the values calculated could be written into memory.
Finally in writeback state, there was nothing we needed to implement at this time.
